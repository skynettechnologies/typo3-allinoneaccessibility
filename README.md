### European Countries Accessibility Standards

Our SkynetAccessibility Scanner Application aligns with European country-level accessibility requirements, including (but not limited to):

- **Germany** — BITV 2.0 (Barrierefreie Informationstechnik-Verordnung)  
- **France** — RGAA (Référentiel Général d’Amélioration de l’Accessibilité)  
- **Spain** — UNE 139803 (Spanish accessibility technical standard)  
- **Italy** — Stanca Act (Legislative Decree on Accessibility of ICT)

> Note: EN 301 549 is the EU-level harmonized standard that maps to WCAG and is widely used as the technical reference for accessibility across EU member states. Individual countries may have additional national guidance and implementation specifics — the scanner flags issues against common technical checks and can be mapped to local regulations for reporting.
